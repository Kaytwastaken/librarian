# librarian v0.2.0
A Discord bot for managing book recommendations!


## Hosting
As Librarian is intended to store book recommendations for each community it's used in, there is no public instance of the bot. Proceed to [Setup](#setup) for instructions to run your own instance.
## Setup (WIP)
Follow the steps below to set up your own instance of the bot!
### Config
Change keys in env.txt to their appropriate values and rename the file to .env
#### Token
The token is like your bot's password - **Do not share it!** In the event your token is compromised you can change it through Discord's developer portal.

#### Prefix
The prefix to use for commands in chat. The default is 'lib!' so commands would look like `lib!help`.

#### Unhandled Error
The message to send in the event of an unhandled error.
